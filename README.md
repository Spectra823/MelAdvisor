# MelAdvisor
MelAdvisor is an App developed by Carla Marcos Vázquez (aka Spectra820) as a Final Highschool Project for the BIE (Bachillerato de Investigación y Excelencia).
This app's purpose if to classify images of Pigmented Skin Lesions in two groups: melanomas and nevus. In the future it will be possible for the app to classify the image in more types of lesions, but at first we weill only focus on this two until the app is stable enough to improve upon.

The Convolutional Neural Network utilized in this project was also created by Carla for it's exclusive use in this project. 

The app will be available as an APK in this Github for the time being, and might get uploaded to the Google Play Store in the future, time permitting. Making it work on iOS devices is not something I'll be focused on anytime soon, so for now it'll stay as an Android exclusive.
